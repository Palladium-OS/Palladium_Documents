[B]Palladium OS[/B] is not yet another ubiquitous os but a trendsetter of its own level. The Prime focus here is on speed, stability and above all, it's a community-driven os where everyone can experience their ideas
without any limitations. All these are complemented by the Meteor Fall program which is a series of OTA updates
that adds in new features and suggestions. So, now you know why it's christened [B]The Palladium OS[/B].
